   <p>There are many different kinds of Guitars for Worship Music. Each song calls for a certain sound and guitars are crafted to give those certain sounds. If you want a sound to stand out in front of the band during a show, you should play something with single coil pickups such as: Fender Telecaster, Fender Stratocaster, ect. If you want a big "rock n roll" sound, you should play something with humbucker pickups, such as: Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, ect. 
        There are also guitars that have a pickup in them called a P90. These pickups are a in-between pickup from a humbucker or single coil pickup. Guitars such as: Fender Jazzmaster, and Epiphone Casino have P90s. You can craft your own guitar and make it how you want it! If you want humbucker pickups in a Fender Stratocaster, you can do that! Here are some examples of guitars.
